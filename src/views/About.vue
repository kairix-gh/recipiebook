        <p class="mb-4">This is a collection recipies I've saved over the years - some from friends, some from the internet, and some I made up myself. Originally I was keeping these recipies saved in crazy formats like .txt files, OneNote pages, excel sheets<span class="text-red-500 font-medium px-1">(!)</span>, and all sorts of crazy stuff. It was obviously very unmaintainable and after I started meal prepping it became exceedingly tedious to put together weekly shopping lists, and I would always step 15 or 20 minutes trying to figure out where each recipie was saved.</p>
        <p>Eventually I decided that I would just sit down and take the time to built a simple online solution that I could use to save recipies that I wanted to keep, and also provide a super convenient way to make weekly shopping lists. Thus, this project was born.</p>
